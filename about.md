The Research Triangle PowerShell Users Group is a community of IT administrators, engineers, managers, devops engineers, developers and anyone that has the interest to learn more about PowerShell and automation.

### What we're about

We strive to provide opportunities to educate and promote PowerShell knowledge in the RTP area of North Carolina. In addition to education, we provide opportunities for members to communicate, share ideas, discuss employment opportunities and promote resources to help all members succeed and grow in their careers.

Our meetings can include guest speakers, presentations from members of the group or more informally sessions devoted to collaborating on members projects or scripts. Regardless of ability, you are welcome to attend and encouraged to actively participate. We meet 2x a month; once in person and once as a remote meeting.

We have a number of places on the web where we share content. Please feel free to check out the resources below and join in the conversations wherever possible.
